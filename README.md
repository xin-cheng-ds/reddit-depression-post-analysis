# reddit-depression-post-analysis
Depression is affecting millions of americans, in age group 12-17 alone, 15.08% youth experience major depression episode in 2019, right before the COVID-19 pandemic. There's some research showing that depression rate trippled during the pandenmic. Those figures are alarming and shocking. 

I am very concerned about the mental health problems that impede the youths from living a full and happy life. I want to understand their struggles and issues they deal with. Reddit is a good place to start the understanding, although it's not comprehensive, many people suffer from severe depression are reluctant or even feel shameful to talk about their depression online. 

Here I analysed posts from depression subreddit, using NLP to separate the topics and plot them in 2D dimensions.

Hope everyone who suffer from mental health issues can get real help. And there is always help, always hope.
